This is nowhere near being usable, let alone stable. Please treat as a proof of concept while we work on getting this to a stable state. **Do not run Fathom in production yet unless you like spending time on it.** Things will keep changing for the next few months.

1. compile into binary & prepare assets: `make all` 
1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and set your database credentials.
